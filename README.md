# Recognition: Face Recognition System

## Project Description
This project is a face verification system that uses the Eden AI API to compare facial images and determine if they belong to the same person. Users can register, list, delete, and verify faces using static image inputs, with local image storage and optional AWS S3 integration for remote backups. Instead of running face recognition locally, the system offloads the comparison task to Eden AIâ€™s cloud-based API, enabling accurate and scalable verification without the need for a heavy deep learning model on-device. 
The codebase is modular and includes separate scripts for each operation, along with structured logging for monitoring and debugging. While the system currently works with uploaded images, it is flexible and can be extended to support real-time webcam-based input if needed. This makes it suitable for lightweight deployments in secure authentication, user onboarding, or ID verification systems. The design prioritizes clarity, modularity, and cloud compatibility for real-world use.

## Features

- **Face Detection and Recognition**: Detects faces in images and matches them against a database of known faces.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Stores and retrieves images from an S3 bucket.
- **MySQL Database**: Manages face data and metadata.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the system.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` for managing sensitive credentials.
