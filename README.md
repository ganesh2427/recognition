# Recognition: Face Recognition System













## Project Description
This project is a face verification system that uses the Eden AI API to compare facial images and determine if they belong to the same person. Users can register, list, delete, and verify faces using static image inputs, with local image storage and optional AWS S3 integration for remote backups. Instead of running face recognition locally, the system offloads the comparison task to Eden AI’s cloud-based API, enabling accurate and scalable verification without the need for a heavy deep learning model on-device. 

The codebase is modular and includes separate scripts for each operation, along with structured logging for monitoring and debugging. While the system currently works with uploaded images, it is flexible and can be extended to support real-time webcam-based input if needed. This makes it suitable for lightweight deployments in secure authentication, user onboarding, or ID verification systems. The design prioritizes clarity, modularity, and cloud compatibility for real-world use.

## Background

This project implements a modular face verification system that utilizes Eden AI’s cloud-based face recognition API to compare and verify facial identities. It allows users to register, list, delete, and verify faces using static images, eliminating the need for real-time webcam input or locally hosted deep learning models. Optional integration with AWS S3 enables remote storage and backup of face data. The system leverages cloud intelligence for accurate verification, providing a lightweight, scalable solution suitable for various authentication and security applications.

### Context and Motivation

With the rapid growth of digital identity systems, face recognition has become a cornerstone in biometric authentication — from online onboarding and secure access control to surveillance and law enforcement. However, deploying accurate and efficient facial recognition solutions often requires high computational resources and complex infrastructure, which may not be practical for lightweight systems or developers lacking deep learning expertise. Traditional on-device recognition models can also face challenges related to scalability, maintenance, and performance in real-world scenarios.

To address these limitations, this project adopts a cloud-first approach by integrating with Eden AI’s face recognition API. This eliminates the burden of model training, infrastructure scaling, and version control — making advanced face verification accessible, fast, and easily deployable.

### Objectives

This project aims to build a user-friendly, API-driven face verification system with the following goals:

Cloud-based Recognition: Integrate Eden AI's face recognition API to compare image pairs and provide match results using similarity scores.

Modular Design: Develop clear and independent scripts for face registration, listing, deletion, and verification.

Cloud Storage: Allow optional uploading of face data to AWS S3 for backup, remote access, or distributed use.

Static Image Input: Operate on uploaded image files (not real-time webcam) for more control and reproducibility.

Extensibility: Maintain code flexibility to easily support future features like real-time webcam input or alternative APIs.

### Significance of the Study

This project demonstrates that robust face verification can be achieved without relying on heavy local models by offloading the intelligence to reliable cloud services like Eden AI. The system offers a practical, resource-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning deployments, making it suitable for developers, startups, and organizations seeking to integrate biometric features without investing in complex infrastructure. Its clean modular structure encourages reuse and adaptation for different applications such as secure onboarding, user verification, or automated ID validation. Furthermore, with optional AWS S3 support, it showcases a hybrid design combining cloud computation and cloud storage — laying the groundwork for future extensions such as multi-user web apps or real-time monitoring interfaces.










## System Functionality Overview

The face verification system deployed through this application is designed to support four essential operations: Add Face, List Face, Recognize Face, and Delete Face. Each operation is seamlessly integrated with a cloud-based backend using the Eden AI Face Recognition API, and all user data is securely managed through a database where each entry is uniquely identified using a generated face_id.

### 1. Add Face
This operation allows users to register their identity into the system by providing the following details:

   Name

   Email ID (used as the primary key)

      Facial Image

Once submitted:

The image is uploaded and processed through the Eden AI API.

A unique face_id is generated by the API for the user's facial features.

This face_id, along with the user's name, email, and image metadata, is stored in the system database.

This feature lays the foundation for future verification by ensuring each registered face is uniquely identifiable.

### 2. List Face
This feature retrieves the stored image and metadata for any registered user. The user needs to provide:

   Name

   Email ID

The system will:

Search the database for the provided email ID.

If a match is found, the system displays the user’s previously uploaded facial image and stored details.

This feature is useful for reviewing enrolled identities.

### 3. Recognize Face
This feature verifies whether an uploaded face matches a previously registered identity. To perform recognition, the user must submit:

   Name

   Email ID

   Facial Image (to be verified)

Internally, the system:

Fetches the stored face_id associated with the provided email.

Sends both the stored face and the newly uploaded face to the Eden AI API.

The API performs face comparison and returns whether the two images match, along with a similarity score.

This task is core to the face verification system and enables reliable identity authentication.

### 4. Delete Face
This operation removes a user’s facial data from the system. The user must provide:

   Name

   Email ID

Upon submission:

The system identifies the user via the email ID.

All associated data (face ID, image, and metadata) is permanently deleted from the database.

This ensures users have control over their data and supports privacy compliance.
